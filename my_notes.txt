BASH (Unix Shell) -- My notes

Commands:
- ls
List all file and directories in the work directory
	. parameter -l:
	  list all file and directory more in detail
	. *.<ext> Displays all file with the desired extension

- echo <smth_to_print>
Prints string to screen, but also environment variables.
- echo "<some_text>" >> <filename>
Append text to a file

- mkdir <new_dir>
Create a new directory in working directory

- rm -d <dir>
Remove an existing directory

- cp <path_file_to_copy> <path_in_which_to_copy>
Copy a file to another location
	. it is possible to concat statements with semicolon ;

- cat <filename>
Visualize a text file (only .txt?) in bash shell.

- less <filename>
Visualize a cut-content of a long (.txt?) file
	. with flag -FX behaves like cat

- head -<n> <filename>
Print in the shell the first <n> rows of <filename>

- tail -<n-1> <filename>
Print in the shell the last <n> rows of <filename>

- sed -i 's/old-text/new-text/g' input.txt
The s is the substitute command of sed for find and replace
It tells sed to find all occurrences of ‘old-text’ and replace with ‘new-text’ in a file named input.txt

- whoami
Command whoami tells us the domain name also.

- pwd
Displays current working directory

- cat <filename> | wc -l
The wc command is used to find the number of lines, characters, words, and bytes of a file.
To find the number of lines using wc, we add the -l option. This will give us the total number of lines and the name of the file.
We can tell the shell to redirect the file to standard input of the wc -l command. This will give us the number of lines without the filename.
